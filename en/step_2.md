## Move the player sprite

Start by creating a `player` sprite that can move around your world. 

--- task ---

Open the 'Create your own world' Scratch starter project.

Download the starter project [rpf.io/p/en/create-your-own-world-scratch2-go](http://rpf.io/p/en/create-your-own-world-scratch2-go){:target="_blank"}, and then open it using the offline editor.
If you need to download and install the Scratch offline editor, you can find it at [rpf.io/scratchoff](https://rpf.io/scratchoff).

Pressing the arrow keys should move the `player` sprite around. When the up arrow is pressed, the `player` sprite should move upwards on the Stage in response.

--- task ---

Add this code to the `player` sprite:

![player](images/player.png)

```blocks
when flag clicked
forever
	if <key [up arrow v] pressed? > then
		point in direction (0)
		move (4) steps
	end
end
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click the flag and then hold down the up arrow. Does the `player` sprite move up?

--- /task ---

--- task ---

To move the `player` sprite to the left, you need to add another `if`{:class="blockcontrol"} block with similar code:

![player](images/player.png)

```blocks
when flag clicked
forever
	if <key [up arrow v] pressed? > then
		point in direction (0)
		move (4) steps
	end
	+if <key [left arrow v] pressed? > then
		point in direction (-90)
		move (4) steps
	end
end
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add more code to your `player` sprite so it can move down and to the right as well. Use the code you already have to help you.

--- hints ---

--- hint ---

To move up, you point the `player` sprite in the direction `0` degrees. What do you have to do to move the sprite down?

To move left, you point the sprite in the direction `-90` degrees. What do you have to do to move the sprite right?

--- /hint ---

--- hint ---

You need to change these two blocks:

![player](images/player.png)

```blocks
<key [ v] pressed>

point in direction ()
```

Duplicate the code that makes the `player` sprite move upwards, and change these two blocks to make the sprite move down. Duplicate the code again, and change it to make the sprite move to the right.

Here is how your code should look:

![player](images/player.png)

```blocks
when flag clicked
forever
	if <key [up arrow v] pressed? > then
		point in direction (0)
		move (4) steps
	end
	if <key [left arrow v] pressed? > then
		point in direction (-90)
		move (4) steps
	end
+    if <key [down arrow v] pressed? > then
		point in direction (180)
		move (4) steps
	end
+    if <key [right arrow v] pressed? > then
		point in direction (90)
		move (4) steps
	end
end
```
