## Challenge: extend your world

You can now continue creating your own world! Here are some ideas:

  + Add more coins to your game in different rooms. Can you let some coins be guarded by patrolling enemies?
  + Change your game's backdrops
  + Add sound and music to your game
  + Add more people, enemies, and signs
  + Add red and yellow doors, and special keys to open them
  + Add more rooms to your world
  + Add other useful items to your game

+ Use coins to get information from other people:

+ You could even add doors in the north and south walls of room 1, so that the player can move between rooms in all four directions. For example, your game can have nine rooms in a 3Ã—3 grid. You can then add `3` to the room number to move down one level.
