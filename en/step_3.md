## Solid walls

Test your `player` sprite again. Do you see that it can walk through the light grey walls.

To fix this, you need to make the `player` sprite move back if it touches a light grey wall. Here's the code you need to add inside your `forever`{:class="blockcontrol"} block below the direction blocks:

![player](images/player.png)

```blocks
when flag clicked
forever
	if <key [up arrow v] pressed? > then
		point in direction (0)
		move (4) steps
	end
	if <key [left arrow v] pressed? > then
		point in direction (-90)
		move (4) steps
	end
		if <key [down arrow v] pressed? > then
		point in direction (-180)
		move (4) steps
	end
		if <key [right arrow v] pressed? > then
		point in direction (90)
		move (4) steps
	end
+	if < touching color [#BABABA]? > then
	move (-4) steps
	end
end
```

Try to make the `player` sprite move through a wall. If your new code works, this shouldn't be possible.
