## People

Add other people to your world who your `player` sprite can interact with.

--- task ---
Switch to the `person` sprite.

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Add some code to the `person` sprite so that the person talks to the `player` sprite. This code is very similar to the code you added to your `sign` sprite:

![person](images/person.png)

```blocks
when flag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (-150)
forever
	if < touching [player v]? > then
		say [Did you know that you can go through orange and yellow doors?]
	else
		say []
	end
end
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Allow your `person` sprite to move by adding these two blocks in the `else`{:class="blockcontrol"} section of your code:

![person](images/person.png)

```blocks
when flag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (-150)
forever
	if < touching [player v]? > then
		say [Did you know that you can go through orange and yellow doors?]
	else
		say []
+		move (1) steps
+		if on edge, bounce
	end
end

```
--- /task ---

Your `person` sprite will now move, but will stop to talk to the `player` sprite.

--- task ---
Add code to your new `person` sprite so that the sprite only appears in room 1. The code you need is exactly the same as the code that makes the `sign` sprite only visible in room 1.

Make sure you test out your new code.
